# AI Development Workflow Assignment

This repository contains a skeleton implementation and documentation for the AI Development Workflow assignment (predicting 30-day hospital readmissions).

Contents:
- data/: dataset schema and (optional) synthetic sample
- src/: preprocessing, training, evaluation, and serving stubs
- notebooks/: EDA and experiment notebooks (placeholders)
- docs/: deployment plan and privacy/security notes

To run (example):
1. Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt
2. Prepare your data and update `data/schema.md` and `src/data_processing.py` to point to your files
3. Run `python src/train_model.py` to train a baseline model
